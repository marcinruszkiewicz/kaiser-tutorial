This is the repository of the example code for the ["I'm a Rockstar developer!"](https://polcode.com/blog/im-a-rockstar-developer-building-a-rockstar-language-transpiler/) series of articles that I'm writing for our company blog.

This is a pretty useful version of the transpiler, however it's very limited in comparison to the [real thing](https://github.com/marcinruszkiewicz/kaiser-ruby).

I've tried to keep the commits consistent, so you can follow the articles and see all the changes made.
